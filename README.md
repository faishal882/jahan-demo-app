# WSGI Framework - Jahan

This is a simple WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) framework called Jahan. It provides a basic structure for building web applications in Python. It includes a Request object, a Response object, and a Router object for handling incoming HTTP requests and generating appropriate responses.


Note:
-----
This repository also contains `WSGIserver`, which can be used to serve WSGI application builtin in `Jahan`
Further documentation can be found [Here](#wsgiserver)


## How to Use:

1. Create an instance of the `Jahan` class and define your web application routes using the `add_route` method.

2. Define callback functions for each route. Each callback function should take a `Request` object as its first argument.

3. The callback function should process the request, generate a response (either a `Response` object or a `TemplateResponse` object), and return it.

4. Run the application using the `run()` method of the `Jahan` class.

5. The application will start serving at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. You can access the application in your web browser.

Demo application:
first clone the repository containing Jahan Framework
```
git clone https://github.com/faishal882/jahan-demo-app.git
``` 
It already has demo application built, After cloning the file structure must be in
```
demo_jahan_app/
    /app
      __init__.py
      src.py
      models.py
    /jahan (this folder contains the Framework)
      __init__.py
      /tests
        tests.py
      jahan.py
    /templates
      add_employee.html
      employees.html
    main.py
    ...
```
Please create and start and virtual enviornment before running the application
```
python -m venv <env-name>
```
In windows activate  virtual enviornment
```
<env-name>/Scripts/activate.bat
```
Install pre-run requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To run the application locally with wsgiref server
```
python main.py
```
The application will start serving at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. You can access the application in your web browser.

### To run the application locally with custom WSGIServer:
1) paste this code in main.py, after importing WSGIServer class from server module
```
    if __name__ == '__main__':
      try:
         server = WSGIServer('localhost', 8000, application)
         server.serve_forever()
      except KeyboardInterrupt:
         print("exit")
```

2) run
```
python main.py
```
The application will start serving at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. You can access the application in your web browser.



## Classes and Functions:

1. `Request` class:
   A wrapper for WSGI environment dictionaries. It provides read-only access to various properties of the HTTP request, such as query string parameters, request method, path, and WSGI environment.

2. `Response` class:
   A class for creating HTTP responses. It allows you to set the response body, status code, content type, and other response headers.

3. `TemplateResponse` class:
   An inherited class from `Response`. It allows you to render a Jinja2 template and use it as a response.

4. `Router` class:
   A class for storing URL routes and their corresponding callbacks. It provides methods to add new routes and match a URL path to a specific callback.

5. `Jahan` class:
   The main application class that represents a single web application. It includes a router to handle URL routing. It is a callable WSGI application.

## Methods and Properties:

1. `Request` class:

   - `get_qs`: Returns a dictionary of query string parameters provided by the user.
   - `get_post`: Returns a dictionary of data provided by the user via POST method.
   - `path`: Returns the path of the request.
   - `method`: Returns the method of the request (e.g., GET, POST, etc.).
   - `env`: Returns the whole WSGI environment passed in the request.

2. `Response` class:

   - `status`: Returns the HTTP status code and reason phrase of the response.
   - `__iter__()`: Iterates over the response body and yields data to be sent to the client.

3. `TemplateResponse` class:

   - `__iter__()`: Renders the Jinja2 template and yields the response body. Jinja2 templating engine is implemented, so context can be simply accessed in html using {{ context }}. For further documentation please visit offical documentation site of Jinja.

   ```
   TemplateResponse("template.html", context={"Name": "John"})
   ```

   In html file

   ```
   <p>{{ Name }}</p>
   ```

4. `Router` class:

   - `add_route(pattern, callback)`: Adds a new URL route with a corresponding callback function.
   - `match(path)`: Matches a URL path with a callback function from the routing table.

5. `Jahan` class:

   - `run()`: Starts the WSGI application with the built-in python wsgiref server.
   - `add_route(route)`: Adds a new route object to the router.The argument given should be regex.
     This is decorator method,
     Use:

   ```bash
   app = Jahan(__name__)

   @app.add_route(r"/$")
   def hello_world(request):
     pass
   ```

   In above code hello_world is added to url route `<your-domain-name>/` as callback function

## Application Workflow:

1. The `Jahan` class creates an instance of the `Router` class to store URL routes and their callbacks.

2. The user defines URL routes using the `add_route` decorator method of the `Jahan` class and provides corresponding callback functions.

3. When an HTTP request is received, the `application` method of the `Jahan` class is called.

4. The `Router` class matches the URL path of the request with a callback function from the routing table. Routing table stores all the url routes with its callback function

5. The matched callback function is called with a `Request` object as its argument.

6. The callback function processes the request, generates a response, and returns it as a `Response` object.

7. The `application` method sets the response status and headers, and iterates over the response body to send it to the client.

8. The WSGI server starts serving the application, and it continues to serve incoming requests until it is terminated.

## Dependencies:

The framework uses the following Python standard libraries and third-party modules:

- `re`: For regular expressions.
- `urllib`: For parsing query string and post data.
- `http` module: For handling HTTP status codes and reason phrases.
- `wsgiref.headers`: For handling response headers.
- `wsgiref.simple_server`: For creating a simple WSGI server.
- `jinja2.Template`: For rendering Jinja2 templates.

WSGIServer 
===============

The `WSGIServer` class is a simple WSGI server that implements the Python WSGI protocol for running web applications on a local machine. It is used to serve WSGI applications like the `Jahan` class defined in the Jahan framework.

Class Attributes:
-----------------
- `host`: str, the host IP address or domain name where the server will listen for incoming connections.
- `port`: int, the port number on which the server will listen for incoming connections.
- `app`: WSGI application, a callable object conforming to the WSGI interface.

Methods:
--------
1. `__init__(self, host: str, port: int, app)`
   - Initialize the `WSGIServer` instance with the given host, port, and WSGI application.

2. `handle_request(self, client_socket)`
   - Handle an incoming client request by parsing the request, invoking the provided WSGI application, and sending back the response to the client.
   - Parameters:
     - `client_socket`: socket, the client socket representing the incoming connection.

3. `start_response(self, status, response_headers)`
   - Callback function for the WSGI application to set the response status and headers.
   - Parameters:
     - `status`: str, the HTTP status code and message (e.g., '200 OK').
     - `response_headers`: list of tuples, containing the response headers (e.g., [('Content-Type', 'text/html')]).

4. `send_response(self, client_socket, response)`
   - Send the HTTP response to the client.
   - This method takes the response generated by the WSGI application and sends it back to the client through the provided client socket. The response includes the HTTP status line, headers, and the response body.
   - Parameters:
     - `client_socket`: socket, the client socket representing the incoming connection.
     - `response`: WSGI response, the response generated by the WSGI application.

5. `serve_forever(self)`
   - Start the WSGI server and listen for incoming connections indefinitely until interrupted.
   - This method binds the server socket to the provided host and port, starts listening for incoming connections, and handles each connection in a separate thread.
   - The server will keep running until a KeyboardInterrupt (Ctrl+C) is received, at which point it will close the server socket and stop listening for new connections.

Dependencies:
-------------
The `WSGIServer` class relies on the `socket`, `threading`, and `io` modules from the Python standard library.

Usage Example:
--------------
1). Create an instance of the `WSGIServer` class and provide the `Jahan` application as the WSGI application.
```
server = WSGIServer('127.0.0.1', 8000, Jahan('MyApp').application)
```

2). Start the server and listen for incoming connections.
```
server.serve_forever()
```


3). The server will run on http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and will serve the `Jahan` web application.

Note:
-----
The `WSGIServer` implementation may not cover all security issues, so it's best suited for local development and testing purposes.
